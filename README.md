# DreamShare
DreamShare is a social platform where users can anonymously share their dreams and explore the dreams posted by others. It offers a unique method of user authentication, called DID login, which provides a seamless and secure way for users to access their accounts without the hassle of remembering passwords.

# Features
## DID Login:
Users can register using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), allowing them to authenticate without traditional usernames and passwords. The DID file is stored locally, ensuring that returning users can log in by simply using their file, maintaining privacy and security.

## Browse Dreams:
Upon login, users can browse an array of dreams shared by the community. Each post displays the username, the title of the dream, and tagged categories for easy navigation.

## Post & Tag Dreams:
When inspired to share, users can post their own dreams, detailing the title and content. They can also tag their dream with categories such as horror, fantasy, love, comedy, or other to categorize the dream appropriately.
